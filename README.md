# Python-Todo-List-CLI
A simple command-line To-Do list application written in Python.
This application provides a robust and intuitive system for task and list management, operable entirely from the Command Line Interface (CLI). It is designed to handle daily tasks, shopping lists, or general progress lists, offering the user complete control over list elements without requiring a Graphical User Interface.


Code Structure,"The application is built upon an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) architecture, utilizing a central class (TodoApp) to encapsulate application state (the list) and core business logic."


State Management,"Implements advanced list functionalities, including dedicated Undo and Redo operations that manage the history stack for reversible actions."
Prioritization & Status,"Employs text markers to track task status ([DONE]) and urgency level ([!!!]), with dedicated functions to prioritize and reorder tasks accordingly."


Input/Output Handling,"Includes robust input validation and exception handling (e.g., try-except for ValueError and index boundary checks) for a resilient user experience."


Core Functions,"Efficient CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, along with search and persistence features (saving the list to a file)."
